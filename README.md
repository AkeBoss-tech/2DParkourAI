# 2DParkourAI
This is the single player and AI version of this simple platform style parkour game.
# The Game
The player is a box character who only has the ability to move up and down. The player has to try and get as far as they can in the level without falling of the platforms. 
There single player version has six powerups while the AI version has four. 
# The Code
The single player game uses pygame. While the AI version also uses NEAT. The AI takes 16 inputs and there are around 250 AIs on one screen. Feel free to change the config text file to meet your needs.
# About
I made this game to learn more about AI. Although there aren't any images, the game is still fun to play.

Here's a video of the model training

Don't be fooled by the speed in the beginning. The further you go the faster it gets, only bots can stay alive after 100 points ;)
